QuicMic runs a tiny server on your computer and serves a web page to your phone. The phone captures your microphone and streams raw PCM audio back over **WebTransport (QUIC/UDP)** — with an automatic **WebSocket (TCP)** fallback — into a virtual audio device, so any app on your PC (Discord, OBS, Zoom, games…) can use your phone as a microphone.

## ✨ Features

- **Low latency** — unreliable QUIC datagrams over LAN, a lock-free SPSC ring buffer, and on-the-fly resampling keep mouth-to-speaker delay small.
- **No installation on the phone** — it's just a web page; works on iOS Safari, Android Chrome, and desktop browsers.
- **Secure pairing** — a random 6-digit PIN with brute-force lockout; the PIN never leaves the device in plaintext requests.
- **QR-code setup** — scan the code printed in the terminal to open the page pre-filled with the PIN.
- **Live audio controls** — noise gate, gain, and latency-recovery sliders, adjustable at runtime from the phone.
- **Eco Mode** — a black-screen overlay that keeps streaming alive while saving battery / preventing OLED burn-in.
- **Resilient** — automatic reconnect on transient drops, instant handover on page refresh, and reliable shutdown detection.
- **Single self-contained binary** — the web assets are embedded; no runtime dependencies.

## 📦 Requirements

- A **virtual audio output device** on the PC (see [setup](#-virtual-audio-device-setup)). QuicMic plays the incoming audio into it; other apps then select it as their microphone.
- A phone/tablet and PC **on the same local network**.
- A modern browser on the phone (see [Supported browsers](#-supported-browsers)).

## 🎚️ Virtual audio device setup

QuicMic outputs to a virtual device. Install one and (optionally) pass its name with `--device`.

<details>
<summary><b>Windows</b> — VB-CABLE</summary>

1. Install [VB-CABLE](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/). The default device name is **`CABLE Input`** (QuicMic's default on Windows).
2. In the app where you want to use the mic, select **`CABLE Output`** as the microphone.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>macOS</b> — BlackHole</summary>

1. Install [BlackHole](https://existential.audio/blackhole/) (e.g. `brew install blackhole-2ch`). QuicMic's default device name is **`BlackHole`**.
2. Select **BlackHole** as the input device in your target app.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Linux</b> — PulseAudio / PipeWire null sink</summary>

```bash
# Create a virtual sink named "VirtualQuicMic" (QuicMic's default on Linux).
pactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=VirtualQuicMic \
  sink_properties=device.description=VirtualQuicMic
```

Your apps can then use the sink's monitor as a microphone source.

## ⬇️ Installation

### Download a release

Grab the latest binary for your platform (Windows/Linux/macOS, x86_64 and arm64) from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Fix3dll/QuicMic/releases) page, extract it (`.zip` on Windows, `.tar.xz` on Linux/macOS), and run it from a terminal.

> **Unsigned binaries.** The release builds are not code-signed, so the OS may warn on first run:
> - **Windows (SmartScreen):** click **More info → Run anyway**.
> - **macOS (Gatekeeper):** right-click the binary and choose **Open**, or run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ./quicmic`.

### Build from source

Requires a [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) (built and tested with **Rust 1.96**; CI builds on `stable`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fix3dll/QuicMic.git
cd quicmic
cargo build --release
# binary at target/release/quicmic (quicmic.exe on Windows)
```

<details>
<summary><b>Building with w64devkit</b> (MinGW-w64 / the <code>x86_64-pc-windows-gnu</code> toolchain)</summary>

Most Windows Rust installs use the **MSVC** toolchain (the default), which builds QuicMic with no extra steps. If you instead build with the **`x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`** toolchain on a recent **[w64devkit](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit)**, the link step can fail with:

```text
error: linking with `cc` failed
  = note: ... cannot find -lgcc_eh
```

Recent w64devkit builds (GCC 16.x) merge the unwinder into `libgcc.a` and no longer ship a separate `libgcc_eh.a`, but Rust's gnu target still asks the linker for it. Create an **empty** `libgcc_eh.a` in your toolchain's library directory — the real unwinder lives in `libgcc.a`, so this stub only satisfies the linker and does not change the resulting binary:

```sh
# Run from the w64devkit shell. Places the stub next to the real libgcc.a.
ar rcs "$(dirname "$(gcc -print-libgcc-file-name)")/libgcc_eh.a"
```

Then `cargo build` works normally. This is a one-time, machine-local toolchain step — nothing in the repository needs to change. See [w64devkit#52](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit/issues/52) for background.

</details>

### pnpm tasks (optional)

If you use pnpm, the root `package.json` exposes the common Cargo workflows as scripts (no JS dependencies are installed — pnpm is purely a task runner here):

```bash
pnpm dev              # cargo run --release
pnpm build            # cargo build --release
pnpm test             # cargo test
pnpm run app:install  # release build + install /Applications/QuicMic.app (macOS)
```

`app:install` wraps `scripts/make-app.sh`, which bundles the release binary into a menu-bar-only (`LSUIElement`) app bundle and ad-hoc signs it. Launch it afterwards with `open -a QuicMic`. Note there is deliberately **no** `install` script — that name would collide with pnpm's built-in dependency install.

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Make sure your virtual audio device is installed and start the server:

   ```bash
   quicmic
   ```

   It prints a banner with the URL, PIN, and a QR code.

2. On your phone, either **scan the QR code** or open the printed `https://<PC-IP>:8443` URL and enter the PIN.

3. Tap the microphone button to start streaming. Long-press it to mute.

### ⚠️ "Your connection is not secure" — this is expected

QuicMic generates a **self-signed TLS certificate** on the fly (a LAN IP can't get a publicly trusted certificate). When you open the page, the browser will warn that the connection is **not private / not secure**. This is normal on your own network:

- Tap **Advanced → Proceed to `<your-PC-IP>` (unsafe)** to continue.
- The low-latency WebTransport stream itself does **not** show this warning — it pins the certificate by hash — but the initial page load over HTTPS does.

### 📱 iOS 18: enable the WebTransport feature flag

On **iOS 18**, WebTransport is behind a feature flag and must be turned on once:

> **Settings → Apps → Safari → Advanced → Feature Flags → `WebTransport`** → enable it.

Without it, QuicMic automatically falls back to the WebSocket transport (slightly higher latency). Newer iOS versions enable WebTransport by default.

### 🎤 Interruptions (calls, other apps)

An incoming call or another app can take the microphone away from the browser. Backgrounding the browser by itself is fine — QuicMic keeps streaming as long as nothing else grabs the mic.

QuicMic won't pretend to still be streaming: brief interruptions usually resolve themselves, and if the microphone is really gone it stops cleanly and says so — just tap the mic button again. It never re-grabs the microphone in the background, so it won't disrupt the app you're using.

> To keep streaming with the screen dark, use 🔋 **Eco Mode** (it holds a screen wake lock).

## 🛠️ Command-line options

Run `quicmic -h` for the full list. The main options:

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-p, --port <PORT>` | `8443` | Port used for **both** HTTPS (TCP) and WebTransport (UDP). Also via `QUICMIC_PORT`. |
| `-d, --device <NAME>` | platform default | Output device, matched as a case-insensitive substring. Defaults: `CABLE Input` (Windows), `BlackHole` (macOS), `VirtualQuicMic` (Linux). Also via `QUICMIC_DEVICE`. |
| `--list-devices` | — | List available audio output devices and exit. |
| `--ip <IP>` | auto-detected | Override the auto-detected LAN IP address. |
| `--pin <PIN>` | random | Use a fixed pairing PIN instead of a random 6-digit one. |
| `--noise-gate <DB>` | `-50` | Initial noise-gate threshold in **dB**, from `-100` (Off) to `0`. Matches the web UI slider. Adjustable at runtime. |
| `--gain <VALUE>` | `1.0` | Initial gain multiplier (`1.0` = unity). Adjustable at runtime. |
| `--latency-threshold <MS>` | `150` | Initial latency-recovery threshold in milliseconds (`0` = off). Adjustable at runtime. |
| `--dump-certs` | — | Write the generated certificate/key to `certs/` for debugging. |
| `--no-update-check` | — | Disable the startup check for a newer release on GitHub (also via `QUICMIC_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`). |
| `-h, --help` / `-V, --version` | — | Show help / version. |

Find your device name first if needed:

```bash
quicmic --list-devices
quicmic --device "CABLE Input"
```

## 🎛️ In-app controls

From the phone's ⚙️ **Settings** panel (synced to the server live):

- **Noise Gate** (−100 dB *Off* … 0 dB) — silences input below a threshold, with a short hold to avoid choppiness.
- **Gain** (0.2×–3.0×) — boosts or attenuates the signal.
- **Latency Recovery** (0 *Off* … 500 ms) — if the server's buffer grows past this, the oldest audio is skipped to catch back up.
- **🔋 Eco Mode** — black-screen overlay; keeps streaming alive behind a screen wake lock.
- **Mute** — long-press the mic button (with haptic feedback on devices that support the Vibration API, e.g. Android; iOS Safari does not).

## 🎨 Customizing the web UI

The web assets (HTML/CSS/JS) are embedded in the binary, but you can override them **without recompiling**: create a `web/` directory next to the executable and drop your modified files in it. QuicMic serves a file from that directory if it exists, otherwise it falls back to the embedded copy.

```
quicmic.exe
web/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── app.js
└── worklet.js
```

Assets are served with a content-based `ETag` and `Cache-Control: no-cache`, so your edits show up on the next reload instead of being cached. Copy the originals from this repository's [`web/`](web/) directory as a starting point.

---

## 🌐 Supported browsers

| Browser | Transport |
| --- | --- |
| iOS Safari (primary target) | WebTransport (see the [iOS 18 flag](#-ios-18-enable-the-webtransport-feature-flag)), else WebSocket fallback |
| Android Chrome / Chromium | WebTransport |
| Desktop Chrome / Edge | WebTransport |
| Desktop Firefox (114+) | WebTransport |
| Older browsers / no WebTransport | WebSocket fallback |

QuicMic tries WebTransport first and transparently falls back to WebSocket when it isn't available, so it still works on browsers without (working) WebTransport support.

## 📊 Resource usage

QuicMic is designed to be lightweight — lock-free hot paths, no allocations per packet, and zero CPU while idle waiting on the network.

![Process Explorer resource usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fix3dll/QuicMic/main/assets/resource-usage.png)

> Captured with Sysinternals **Process Explorer** while streaming, on an Intel Core i7-11800H running Windows 11 (25H2), started with `--no-update-check`.

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

**The page won't load / the phone can't connect**

- Make sure the phone and PC are on the **same network**. Some guest Wi-Fi networks and routers with "AP/client isolation" block device-to-device traffic.
- **Firewall / antivirus.** On first launch, allow QuicMic through **Windows Defender Firewall** when prompted (at least on *Private* networks). Some third-party security suites (for example **ESET**, Norton, Kaspersky) can **silently block** the port with no prompt at all — if you can't connect, open your security software and allow QuicMic, or allow inbound **TCP _and_ UDP on port `8443`** (or whichever `--port` you chose).
- If your PC has several network adapters or a VPN, the auto-detected address may be wrong. Override it with `--ip <your-LAN-IP>`.

**It connects, but the transport shows "WebSocket" instead of "WebTransport"**

That's fine — QuicMic automatically falls back to WebSocket (TCP) when the low-latency WebTransport (UDP/QUIC) path isn't available (the browser doesn't support it, or a firewall blocks UDP). On **iOS 18**, turn on the WebTransport feature flag (see the iOS 18 note above) for the faster path.

**The browser warns the connection isn't secure**

Expected — the certificate is self-signed (see the note above). Tap **Advanced → Proceed**.

**Connected, but the target app has no sound**

In your target app, select the **virtual device's output/monitor** as the microphone (e.g. `CABLE Output` on Windows). Run `quicmic --list-devices` to confirm QuicMic is sending to the right device.

**Choppy audio or high latency**

Usually Wi-Fi congestion. Prefer a **5 GHz** network, move closer to the router, and try lowering the **Latency Recovery** slider in the in-app settings.

## 🔐 Security notes

- Pairing uses a random **6-digit PIN**; after 5 failed attempts **from the same client (tracked per IP)** that client is locked out for 30 seconds, so one bad actor can't lock everyone out.
- PINs and session tokens are compared in **constant time**.
- State-changing API requests are rejected if their `Origin` doesn't match the server's own host (a same-origin guard against cross-site requests).
- Only **one** client may stream at a time.
- The TLS certificate is **self-signed, in-memory, and short-lived** (14 days), regenerated on each start. QuicMic is intended for use on a **trusted local network**, not the public internet.

---

## 🔄 Update check & privacy

On startup, QuicMic makes a single best-effort check for a newer release. It opens one HTTPS request to `github.com` and reads only the redirect that `…/releases/latest` returns — just the `Location` header, so there is **no response body, no JSON, and no telemetry**. The only thing inherently shared is what any HTTPS request reveals to GitHub: your IP address. The check runs on a background task, never blocks startup, and stays silent on any failure.

Opt out with `--no-update-check` or by setting `QUICMIC_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.
