//! Audio subsystem: the lock-free ring buffer, incoming-packet decoding into the
//! ring, and the output device / resampler. Input DSP (noise gate and gain) runs
//! client-side in the AudioWorklet, so the server is a pure passthrough on the
//! receive hot path — it only decodes bytes and hands them to the output stage.
//!
//! Submodules keep each concern — and its tests — self-contained. The public
//! surface used by the rest of the crate is re-exported here.
